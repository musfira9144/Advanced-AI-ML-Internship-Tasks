LangChain is a framework designed to help developers build applications powered by large language models.
It provides tools for prompt management, memory, chains, and integrations with external data sources.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation, also known as RAG, is a technique that enhances language models by retrieving relevant documents from an external knowledge base before generating a response.
RAG helps reduce hallucinations and improves factual accuracy.

FAISS is a vector database library developed by Meta for efficient similarity search.
It is commonly used to store and retrieve document embeddings in machine learning applications.

Embeddings are numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning.
They allow systems to compare text based on meaning rather than exact words.

A context-aware chatbot is capable of remembering previous user interactions and using that history to generate more relevant responses.
This is achieved using conversational memory.

Streamlit is a Python framework used to build interactive web applications for machine learning models.
It allows rapid deployment of AI applications with minimal frontend code.
